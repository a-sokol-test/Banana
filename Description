The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.[8] 
All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm".[9] 
Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to 
be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, 
as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.[10] The 
leaves of banana plants are composed of a "stalk" (petiole) and a blade (lamina). T
he base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the 
pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it 
is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem t
he edges are forced apart.[11] Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety 
and growing conditions. Most are around 5 m (16 ft) tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' p
lants at around 3 m (10 ft) to 'Gros Michel' at 7 m (23 ft) or more.[12][13] Leaves are spirally 
arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) long and 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide.[1] They are easily torn by 
the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.[14]
When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence. 
A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it 
emerges at the top.[15] Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the "banana heart". 
(More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.[16]) After fruiting, the 
pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is p
erennial. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in 
order to maintain spacing.[17] The inflorescence contains many bracts (sometimes incorrectly referred to 
as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows 
further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is inferior, 
meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.[18]

The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of 
tiers (called "hands"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a 
bunch, comprising 3–20 tiers, or commercially as a "banana stem", and can weigh 30–50 kilograms 
(66–110 lb). Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or "finger") average 125 grams 
(0.276 lb), of which approximately 75% is water and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).
